1

We are told that breakfast helps us reduce weight by speeding up our metabolism, and this helps us avoid hunger pangs and overeating later in the day.

2

No negative effects have been found. Having no regular breakfast has not made them fat or unhealthy and they lack most Western diseases.

3

The conclusion is that there is no evidence to support the claim that skipping breakfast makes you put on weight or reduces your resting metabolic rate.

4

The current evidence from these studies shows that skipping breakfast can be an effective way to reduce weight for some people.

5

The authors say that the explanation was based on lab rodents and a few short-term human studies. So it can be inferred that the concept is inaccurate and even wrong.

6

According to the authors, an independent review of over 20 trials on children has shown that the evidence to support breakfast&apos;s benefits on the children&apos;s mental well-being and attention span is weak, inconsistent, and probably biased.

7

The prescriptive diet guidelines are filled with erroneous information. They look increasingly counterproductive and detract from important health messages.

At present, drone delivery is valued in many countries. The United States has approved drones for commercial delivery. China&apos;s Alibaba, JD. com and SF Express have also begun experimenting with drone delivery. But to make the service possible, two big problems must be solved.

One is noise. Drones make noise during flight. The heavier the cargo, the greater the need for larger drones, and larger drones will generate more noise pollution.

The other is privacy. During the flight, drones may collect the residents&apos;personal information, such as home address, family members, vehicle license plate number and daily activities. The

information may be used by evil people and trigger various criminal activities.

These are two major problems that have to be addressed by all companies planning to use drone delivery services.
