Some big minds claimed that artificial intelligence would be smarter than humans. For example, Ray Kurzweil, Google’s Director of Engineering, sent an AI warning in 2017: Robots will be SMARTER than humans by 2045. The year will be where AI comes into its own and becomes the most intelligent species on the planet, according to the Google boss. He said the process is already underway and our reliance on smartphones is just the beginning of the dawn of us becoming part machine.

Martin, S. (2017, October 17). AI warning: Robots will be smarter than humans by 2045, Google boss says. Retrieved December 26, 2019, from [https://www.express.co.uk/news/](https://www.express.co.uk/news/) science/867565/google-artificial-intelligence-ray-kurzweil-AI-singularity

While others argue that machines are good at pattern matching but our ability to learn unlimited patterns means humans will always be smarter than artificial intelligence. Our fate is in our own hands. Since technology depends on the values of its creators, we can make human choices to allow AI to improve the world in a controlled manner.

There are so many amazing ways artificial intelligence is used to impact our everyday lives. AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things. Here are some examples:

• Voice assistants: The built-in smart assistants, like Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and HUAWEI’s Xiaoyi (小E), use AI to understand you and to complete your tasks.

• Smart homes: Your home will be able to predict your preferred room temperature, when you want to eat, when to turn the lights on and off, when to order groceries, etc.

• Autonomous vehicles: Self-driving cars free up people’s time and attention, and improve road safety.

• Delivery: The way you receive packages is set to change, too. You will enjoy the efficient drone delivery service.

• Social media: AI records all your search content, interactions, and everything else that you do and tailors your social media experience just for you.

• Gaming: AI not only makes games more exciting, but also allows the game to automatically match the player’s level.

1✔The anecdote is put at the very beginning of the text

2✔ It is about Nigel Richards winning the French-language Scrabble World Championship, which is real.

3✔ It is described in concise language.

4✔ It is interesting since the winner of French-language Scrabble World Championship does not speak French. It is also inspiring in that he memorized all the words in the entire dictionary. And it sets people thinking about how he made it.

5✔ How Richards memorizes words is similar to how AI works, which is relevant to the subject.

6✔ The first sentence in Para. 2 shows the transition: “Richards’ impressive feat is a useful metaphor for how artificial intelligence works …” This statement helps to transit from the anecdote to the main topic.

7✔ It is mentioned again in Para. 15, which achieves an echo effect.

1 Artificial intelligence: A modern approach;

Russell (2015, p. 4) defines a rational agent as “one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.”

2 Kurzweil

Kurzweil (2006, p. 9) claims, “All the machines we met to date lack the essential subtlety of human biological qualities.”

3 Marvin Minsky

“If a program works in only one way, then it gets stuck when that method fails” (Minsky, 2007, p. 7).

4 page 5–6

According to Kaplan (2016, pp. 5–6), “The broader the domain of application, the quicker conclusions are drawn with minimal information, the more intelligent the behavior.”
