1

Because the ice caps and glaciers have been melting, and the gases contained within the sea have changed.

2

The temperatures showed a steady rise in the past 50 years. They rose more rapidly in the 1970s, remained basically unchanged in the 1990s and rose again in the 2000s.

3

The rise in the number of vehicles and industries has resulted in greenhouse gases getting trapped in the atmosphere. The increased heat in the atmosphere has been absorbed by the oceans, thus the oceans become warmer.

4

Now there are fewer gases there to keep the temperature, so the regions’ climate is easily affected by the warming conditions, resulting in the melting of glaciers.

5

Humans produce more harmful gases in the atmosphere, and these gases are absorbed by the oceans, thus the acid level in the ocean is increasing.

6

They cite statistics that show there hasn’t been a significant temperature change since 1990s.

7

If the climate model calculations are inaccurate, the long-term predictions based on them would be meaningless.

8

One reason is that the weather data scientists used for analysis was from 100 years ago, which wasn’t kept to modern standards of evidence. The other reason is that though data is objective, analysis of the data is not. Scientists might have a bias when interpreting the data.

1 (Answers may vary.)  
If the warming accelerates without being controlled, one day the Earth would become inhabitable not only for humans but for an overwhelming majority of living creatures. A further increase in temperature will cause the ice caps and glaciers to melt, causing sea levels to rise, and drowning coastal cities where most of human civilization is located. Large amounts of plant and animal species will die off, which affects the ecosystem in which humans are an important link. Warmer oceans will cause more severe weather disturbances such as intense hurricanes, typhoons and tsunamis, further causing havoc to our homeland. The absence of our polar caps and glaciers will contribute to further warming since these ice caps help reflect the sun’s heat back into space. Without them, the planet will absorb the sun’s heat more.  
2 (Answers may vary.)  
Since human activity has been a big contributor to recent global climate change, we could make a change by altering some of our behavior. Thus it would make a difference to the Earth.  
• Fly less, carpool and take public transit.  
• If a new car is needed, consider an all-electric one or a hybrid.  
• Shop and eat local; cycle or walk there if possible.  
• Buy products with minimal packaging.  
• Classify waste as required instead of putting it all in the trash.  
• Don’t use plastic water bottles.  
• Don’t use disposable lunchboxes, chopsticks or paper cups.  
• Turn off lights and unplug devices when not in use.  
• Cut meat intake.  
• Recycle as much as possible, and buy recycled items.  
• Keep reusable bags with you.

China is a vast country with a long coastline and is heavily affected by the adverse effects of global warming. China is taking active measures to combat global warming.

Firstly, it will implement the strategy of sustainable development and strengthen environmental protection. Secondly, it will promote energy saving and emission reduction, and control the amount of carbon emissions. Thirdly, it will improve the energy structure and develop new and renewable energy. Lastly, it will expand forest areas.

Forests are significant for absorbing carbon dioxide. The global forest area overall is decreasing, while China’s forest coverage rate is increasing year by year. Global warming will affect everyone who lives on the Earth. As a responsible major country, China will continue to fulfill its responsibilities at present and in the future.

The effects of global warming on animals are expected to be widespread.

**_Ex4_**

（Answers may vary.)

1. Thesis statement:  
   The impact of global warming manifests itself in three aspects: extreme weather conditions, animal extinction and increased respiratory (呼吸的) diseases.
2. Outline:  
   Impact 1: Extreme weather conditions  
   Impact 2: Animal extinction  
   Impact 3: Increased respiratory diseases
3. Body paragraphs:  
   (Topic sentence) It’s undeniable that the weather patterns all around the world today are quite erratic because of global warming. (Supporting evidence and explanation) There is a rise in the amount of rainfall and temperatures. We have frequent floods, hurricanes, and drought being experienced in different regions across the globe. The extreme weather conditions have led to increased natural disasters leading to loss of human, animal and plant life. (Concluding sentence) Global warming is endangering “all citizens” on the Earth by bringing extreme weather conditions to the world.  
   (Topic sentence) Another impact of global warming is animal extinction. (Supporting evidence and explanation) To find more habitable conditions, wild animals are forced to flee their homes and migrate long distances. Those that fail to adapt to the climate change will die. Over a million species are estimated to have gone extinct. (Concluding sentence) As a result, global warming makes the Earth a difficult place for many animals to survive.  
   (Topic sentence) Global warming puts human beings in the danger of increased respiratory diseases. (Supporting evidence and explanation) Because of global warming, air quality becomes much worse than it once was. There has been significant pollution leading to a rise in carbon dioxide emission, which affects the human respiratory system. Common respiratory diseases evolve and new ones appear. (Concluding sentence) Human beings are suffering from respiratory diseases caused by global warming.
