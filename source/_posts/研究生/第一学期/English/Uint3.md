1 (Answers may vary.)

Depression is a common mental health illness. Feeling sad is an integral part of depression. A number of life events can leave people feeling sad. The death of a loved one, loss of a job or income, failure on an exam, or the ending of a relationship can all trigger sadness. It is normal to feel sad in response to such situations. Those experiencing sadness often describe themselves as being “depressed.” But being sad is not the same as having depression.

• Sadness usually passes with time. If it does not pass, or if the person becomes unable to resume normal function, this could be a sign of depression. If low mood gets worse or lasts longer than two weeks, they should seek for professional help.

• In sadness, self-esteem is usually maintained. In depression, there is low self-esteem, and feelings of worthlessness and guilt are common.

• A person experiencing sadness can usually find some relief from crying, opening up to others, or engaging themselves in other activities. Depression is hard to be rid of with the regular methods.

Knowing and understanding the differences between a diagnosis of depression and the emotion of sadness can help people recognize when to get the help, support or treatment they need, which is helpful to recover mental health sooner.

2 (Answers may vary.)

Helping a friend or loved one with depression can be challenging. Here are some tips:

• Understand the symptoms. The symptoms of depression vary from person to person. Knowing the symptoms will help you better understand what your loved one is experiencing.

• Practice compassionate listening. Very often, being a compassionate listener is much more important than giving advice. Encourage the depressed person to talk about their feelings, and be willing to listen. Accept them as they are, without judging them.

• Encourage treatment. The depressed person may believe that the situation is hopeless and treatment pointless. You can present examples of depressed people having turned for the better through right treatment. Help them see that it can be solved and delaying would just make things worse.

• Lead by example. Encourage the person to lead a healthier, mood-boosting lifestyle by doing it yourself: think positive, eat a balanced diet, avoid alcohol and cigarettes, exercise, and actively seek help if trouble comes in.

• Encourage participation in group activities. Invite your loved one to join in uplifting activities, like going to a comedy movie, having a party, going on walks together, hiking in the nature. But don’t impose anything on them.

Human brain is a very complex organ, which is responsible for a multitude of functions. And a large number of those functions remain yet unknown. There is still ongoing research on the composition and functions of brain. Each part of the brain is responsible for some essential functions, without which the body will not be able to function normally. That attribute makes brain the most essential part of the human body.
