They use people’s preferred pronouns — including the gender-neutral singular “they.”

3

They have found that those activists generally support the idea of announcing pronouns on email signatures and in introductions.

4

Highlighting gender often disadvantages women, and may also worsen gender inequality by making women more aware of their own gender identity.

5

By keeping their gender anonymous, they can escape judgments based on gender, and get rid of the obligation to be gendered in the first place.

6

One suggestion is to use “they / them” for everyone, regardless of gender identity. The other is to make Mx. the salutation for everyone or simply do away with salutations altogether.

8

Graduate School of Education, Peking University, used survey data of students from 85 colleges and universities nationwide to analyze the gender differences in major selection among college students. The results showed that male students tended to choose science and engineering majors, while female students preferred to take humanities and social sciences.

There’s nothing wrong with selection differences if male and female students choose their majors based on physiological and psychological factors and interests. But if students lack professional guidance, coupled with the impact of gender stereotypes and the misleading of conventional views, their choices may be detrimental to discipline development and further disadvantage women in the labor market.

It is a basic national policy of China to promote gender equality and women’s development. Based on this, the education sector should reinforce college major selection guidance for high school students, and gradually reduce the negative influence of gender stereotypes and conventional ideas on students’ selection of majors.
